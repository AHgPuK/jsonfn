JSONfn is a plugin to convert jsvascript <span class="highlight">objects with functions </span>into a string and convert this string back to the object.  
</p>
<p>
With this plugin you can easily serialize any javascript object, save this string in a local storage or on a server and when you need it, get the string and convert it back to the object. The main advantage this plugin over the traditional JSON conversion is the fact, that you can convert object with functions!

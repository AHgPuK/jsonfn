JSONfn is a javascript plugin to convert jsvascript <span class="_highlight" style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">object with functions </span>into a string and convert this string back to the object, as well as clone such kind of object.
</p>
<p>
With this plugin you can easily serialize any javascript object, save this string in a local storage or on a server and then get the string and convert it back to object. I repeat it: <b>object with functions!</b> 

</p>

<p>
If you still reading this text, you probably don't need any other arguments to start using this plugin. Well, one more thing: full development version with comments is only <b>1k</b> (2K with license, author, etc :).
</p>

<p>
<b>Node.js</b> version is also available (see Documentation)
